### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michal, currently in my fourth year of aerospace engineering specializing in spacecraft and volunteering at [Formify](https://www.formify.ca/).

Currently working on: 
- Looking into doing a master's in propulsion, orbital dynamics, GNC, spacecraft attitude and control, or other space related stuff
- Trying to find an aerospace-related job post graduation in Ontario
- Compiling old code and writing new code for school/personal use in my [scripts repo](https://github.com/MichaszJ/scripts)
- Working on a [spacecraft orbital toolkit thing](https://github.com/MichaszJ/orbit-tool)

More of my work can be found on [my website](https://michaszj.github.io/).
