Hello! I am a new graduate from the aerospace engineering program at Toronto Metropolitan University.

I'm currently looking for work in the aerospace and software industries in Ontario, as well as looking into doing a MEng or MASc in the spacecraft GN&C field.

More of my work can be found on [my website](https://michaszj.github.io/).
